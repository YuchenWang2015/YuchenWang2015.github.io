I published several pieces of my writing in the Children's Literature Journal as a teenager. Therefore, my dream was always to be a writer. However, I accidentally chose chemistry as my undergraduate major, and begen my stochastic fluctuating in the world of science since then. <br> Currently, I am a fifth year PhD candidate in theoretical and computational chemistry divison at K-State. In my spare time, I like reading literatures from all over the worldüåç, Yoga (Pilates üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è), learning violin üéª, watching Ghibli movies with friends, and playing Mario Kart.
