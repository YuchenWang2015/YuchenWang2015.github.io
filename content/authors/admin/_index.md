I published several pieces of my writing in the Children's Literature Journal as a teenager. Therefore, my dream was always to be a writer. However, I accidentally chose chemistry as my undergraduate major and began my stochastic fluctuating in the world of science since then. <br> Currently, I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in the theoretical and computational chemistry division at K-State. I am interested in using theoretical approaches (specifically, TDDFT and Non-adiabatic dynamics) to investigate the plasmonic characters of silver/gold nanoclusters. I also enjoy collaborating with experimental groups to help them elucidate the reaction mechanisms, and study the ground and excited-state properties. And of course, I am hoping my calculations can provide more physical insights, not just how well it fits the experimental dataüòâ. If you are interested in collaborating with me/my group, please contact me (yuchenwang@ksu.edu) or my supervisor: Prof. Christine Aikens. <br>
In my spare time, I like reading literature from all over the worldüåç, yoga (Pilates üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è), learning violin üéª, watching Ghibli movies with friends, and playing Mario Kart.
