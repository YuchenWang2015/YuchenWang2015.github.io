title: Development of TDDFT approximation methods 
summary: "TDDFT (Time-dependent density functional theory) has been widely applied to calculate the optical properties of both chemical and solid-state systems. However, with the increasing of the system size, the calculations became more expensive and required very high memory. TDDFT+TB is one type of approximation method, which approximating the four electron integrals term in excited state calculations. What I am currently working on is called TDDFT-aas method. Compared with the related TDDFT+TB method that also simplifies the K coupling matrix, TDDFT-aas uses a new type of gamma function that does not depend on tight binding parameters. Currently, we implemented both energy and gradient of the TDDFT-aas. And we are on the ways of testing! ðŸ˜‰ "
