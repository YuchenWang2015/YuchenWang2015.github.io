title: Interaction between diglyme and gold thiolate-protected nanocluster
summary: "The story of diglyme started from a collaboration with the experimental group, where we found the diglyme@gold nanocluster system shows very high stability (https://doi.org/10.1039/D2NR02426H ). We then applied the DFT method and ETS-NOCV theory to study the growth mechanism of gold nanoclusters in the presence of diglyme (https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.2c04218 ). Then, we planned to employ machine learning methods to develop force fields for the gold nanoclusters in explicit solvent molecules (like diglyme solvent). To kick off everything, we are planning to work on training the machine learning potential for the gold nanocluster itself. We are now at the stage of optimizing the machine-learning force fields, Please stay tunedðŸ˜Š"
