title: Plasmon-induced process of silver/gold nanoclusters
summary: "If an electric field is applied to gold or silver nanoparticles with a frequency corresponding to a plasmonic resonance frequency of the system, the valence electrons of the nanoparticles will be excited and will slosh back and forth collectively. Plasmonic characters can be used in many areas such as photocatalysis and biological sensing. <br>
In this project, We use electronic structure calculations and nonadiabatic dynamics to model the plasmon-induced process of silver and gold nanoclusters. We 1. Studied the electric field strength and nanowire length effects on plasmon-enhanced N<sub>2</sub>  dissociation. https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c03686 <br> 2. Studied the connectivity between static field and continuous wave field effects on excitation-induced H<sub>2</sub> activation. https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpca.3c00120 <br> 3. Now investigate the dopping effects of silver nanowire on N<sub>2</sub> acitivation."
